"'ionumbers' stands for 'input/output numbers'. The package restyles numbers "
"in maths mode. If a number in the input file is written, e.g., as $3,231.44$ "
"as commonly used in English texts, the package is able to restyle it to be "
"output as $3\\,231{,}44$ as commonly used in German texts (and vice versa). "
"This may be useful, for example, if you have a large table and want to "
"include it in texts with different output conventions without the need to "
"change the table. The package can also automatically group digits left of "
"the decimal separator (thousands) and right of the decimal separator "
"(thousandths) in triplets without the need of specifing commas (English) or "
"points (German) as separators. E.g., the input $1234.567890$ can be output "
"as $1\\,234.\\,567\\,890$. Finally, an e starts the exponent of the number. "
"For example, $21e6$ may be output as $26\\times10\\,^{6}$.\n"

#. description(texlive-pslatex)
msgid ""
"A small package that makes LaTeX default to 'standard' PostScript fonts. It "
"is basically a merger of the times and the (obsolete) mathptm packages from "
"the psnfss suite. You must have installed standard LaTeX and the psnfss "
"PostScript fonts to use this package. The main novel feature is that the "
"pslatex package tries to compensate for the visual differences between the "
"Adobe fonts by scaling Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing' Courier (i.e. "
"scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is supplied with a (unix) shell "
"file for a 'pslatex' command that allows standard LaTeX documents to be "
"processed, without needing to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a "
"different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier as a lost "
"cause (there are better free fixed-width available now, than there were when "
"pslatex was designed). As a result, pslatex is widely considered obsolete.\n"

"Biblatex is a complete reimplementation of the bibliographic facilities "

"LaTeX interacts with BibTeX at a fairly fundamental level. With biblatex, "
"BibTeX is only used (if it is used at all) to sort the bibliography and to "
"generate labels. Formatting of the bibliography is entirely controlled by "
"TeX macros (the BibTeX-based mechanism embeds some parts of formatting in "
"the BibTeX style file. Good working knowledge in LaTeX should be sufficient "
"to design new bibliography and citation styles; nothing related to BibTeX's "
"language is needed. In fact, users need not remain bound to BibTeX for use "
"with biblatex: an alternative bibliography processor biblatex- biber is "
"available. Development of biblatex and biblatex-biber is closely coupled; "
"the present release of biblatex is designed to work with biblatex-biber "
"version 0.9.3. The package needs e- TeX, and uses the author's etoolbox and "
"logreq packages. For users of biblatex-biber, version 0.9 is required (at "
"least; refer to the notes for the version of biblatex-biber that you are "
"using). Apart from the features unique to biblatex, the package also "
"incorporates core features of the following packages: babelbib, bibtopic, "
"bibunits, chapterbib, cite, inlinebib, mcite and mciteplus, mlbib, multibib, "
"splitbib. Biblatex supports split bibliographies and multiple bibliographies "
"within one document, and separate lists of bibliographic shorthands. "
"Bibliographies may be subdivided into parts (by chapter, by section, etc.) "
"and/or segmented by topics (by type, by keyword, etc.). Biblatex is fully "
"localized and can interface with the babel.\n"

"Type 1 fonts. The font set consists of the 'LaserWriter 35' set (originally "
"'freely available' because embedded in PostScript printers), and a variety "
"of other free fonts, together with some additions. Note that while many of "
"the fonts are available in PostScript (and other) printers, most publishers "
"require fonts embedded in documents, which requires that you have the fonts "
"in your TeX system. Fortunately, there are free versions of the fonts from "
"URW (available in the URW base5 bundle). The base set of text fonts covered "
"by PSNFSS are: AvantGarde, Bookman, Courier, Helvetica, New Century "
"Schoolbook, Palatino, Symbol, Times Roman and Zapf Dingbats. In addition, "
"the fonts Bitstream Charter and Adobe Utopia are covered (those fonts were "
"contributed to the Public Domain by their commercial foundries). Separate "
"packages are provided to load each font for use as main text font. The "
"packages helvet (which allows Helvetica to be loaded with its size scaled to "
"something more nearly appropriate for its use as a Sans-Serif font to match "
"Times) and pifont (which provides the means to select single glyphs from "
"symbol fonts) are tailored to special requirements of their fonts. "
"Mathematics are covered by the mathptmx package, which constructs passable "
"mathematics from a combination of Times Roman, Symbol and some glyphs from "
"Computer Modern, and by Pazo Math (optionally extended with the fpl small-"
"caps and old-style figures fonts) which uses Palatino as base font, with the "
"mathpazo fonts. The bundle as a whole is part of the LaTeX 'required' set of "
"packages.\n"

"HEPparticles is a set of macros for typesetting high energy particle names, "

"Additionally a superscript and/or subscript may follow the main symbol. 3. "
"Particle resonances may also have a resonance specifier which is typeset in "
"parentheses following the main symbol. In general the parentheses may also "
"be followed by sub- and superscripts. 4. The particle names are expected to "
"be used both in and out of mathematical contexts. 5. If the surrounding text "
"is bold or italic then the particle name should adapt to that context as "
"best as possible (this may not be possible for Greek symbols). A consequence "
"of point 5 is that the well-known problems with boldness of particle names "
"in section titles, headers and tables of contents automatically disappear if "

"OFS (Olsak's Font System) is a set of Plain TeX and LaTeX macros for "
"managing large font collections; it has been used by Czech/Slovak users for "
"many years. Main features include: - Mapping from long names of fonts to the "
"metric file name. The user can specify only exact long names in documents. - "
"Support for many font encodings. - Printing of catalogues of fonts and test "
"samples of font families; the interactive macro \\showfonts shows all font "
"families you have installed via OFS. - The user interface is the same for "
"Plain TeX and for LaTeX, but the implementation differs: the LaTeX variant "
"of OFS uses NFSS, but the Plain variant implements its own font management "
"(which may even be better than NFSS) - Support for math fonts including TX "

"The Cyclop typeface was designed in the 1920s at the workshop of Warsaw type "
"foundry \"Odlewnia Czcionek J. Idzkowski i S-ka\". This sans serif typeface "
"has a highly modulated stroke so it has high typographic contrast. The "
"vertical stems are much heavier then horizontal ones. Most characters have "
"thin rectangles as additional counters giving the unique shape of the "
"characters. The lead types of Cyclop typeface were produced in slanted "
"variant at sizes 8-48 pt. It was heavily used for heads in newspapers and "
"accidents prints. Typesetters used Cyclop in the inter-war period, during "
"the occupation in the underground press. The typeface was used until the "
"beginnings of the offset print and computer typesetting era. Nowadays it is "
"hard to find the metal types of this typeface. The font was generated using "
"the Metatype1 package. Then the original set of characters was completed by "
"adding the full set of accented letters and characters of the modern Latin "
"alphabets (including Vietnamese). The upright variant was generated and it "
"was more complicated task than it appeared at the beginning. 11 upright "
"letters of the Cyclop typeface were presented in the book by Filip Trzaska, "
"\"Podstawy techniki wydawniczej\" (\"Foundation of the publishing techonology"
"\"), Warsaw 1967. But even the author of the book does not know what was the "
"source of the presented examples. The fonts are distributed in the Type1 and "
"OpenType formats along with the files necessary for use these fonts in TeX "
"and LaTeX including encoding definition files: T1 (ec), T5 (Vietnamese), "
"OT4, QX, texnansi and nonstandard ones (IL2 for Czech fonts).\n"

"Typesetting values with units requires care to ensure that the combined "

"particular, the SI units system lays down a consistent set of units with "
"rules on how they are to be used. However, different countries and "
"publishers have differing conventions on the exact appearance of numbers "
"(and units). A number of LaTeX packages have been developed to provide "
"consistent application of the various rules: SIunits, sistyle, unitsdef and "
"units are the leading examples. The numprint package provides a large number "
"of number-related functions, while dcolumn and rccol provide tools for "
"typesetting tabular numbers. The siunitx package takes the best from the "
"existing packages, and adds new features and a consistent interface. A "
"number of new ideas have been incorporated, to fill gaps in the existing "
"provision. The package also provides backward-compatibility with SIunits, "
"sistyle, unitsdef and units. The aim is to have one package to handle all of "
"the possible unit-related needs of LaTeX users. The package relies on LaTeX "

"familiar with XML, you should be able to get up and running with XOM very "
"quickly.\n"
"\n"
"XOM is the only XML API that makes no compromises on correctness. XOM only "
"accepts namespace well-formed XML documents, and only allows you to create "
"namespace well-formed XML documents. (In fact, it's a little stricter than "
"that: it actually guarantees that all documents are round-trippable and have "
"well-defined XML infosets.) XOM manages your XML so you don't have to. With "
"XOM, you can focus on the unique value of your application, and trust XOM to "
"get the XML right.\n"
"\n"
"XOM is fairly unique in that it is a dual streaming/tree-based API. "
"Individual nodes in the tree can be processed while the document is still "
"being built. The enables XOM programs to operate almost as fast as the "
"underlying parser can supply data. You don't need to wait for the document "
"to be completely parsed before you can start working with it.\n"
"\n"
"XOM is very memory efficient. If you read an entire document into memory, "
"XOM uses as little memory as possible. More importantly, XOM allows you to "
"filter documents as they're built so you don't have to build the parts of "
"the tree you aren't interested in. For instance, you can skip building text "
"nodes that only represent boundary white space, if such white space is not "
"significant in your application. You can even process a document piece by "
"piece and throw away each piece when you're done with it. XOM has been used "
"to process documents that are gigabytes in size.\n"
"\n"
"XOM includes built-in support for a number of XML technologies including "
"Namespaces in XML, XPath, XSLT, XInclude, xml:id, and Canonical XML. XOM "

"templates (an important concept in the future LaTeX3) and program components "
"for other languages (functions, classes, procedures, etc.). A side effect is "
"that many minor bugs in doc are fixed. The design aims to take advantage of "
"many still experimental features of future versions of LaTeX, but since "
"these are neither reasonably stable nor widely available, the configuration "
"interfaces and package author commands of xdoc are likely to change. To "
"still provide a stable interface for other packages to build upon, the "
